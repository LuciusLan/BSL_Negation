# Negation Scope Refinement via Boundary Shift Loss
------

This repository contains codes for my paper:
> [Yin Wu and Aixin Sun. 2023. Negation Scope Refinement via Boundary Shift Loss. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2023. Association for Computational Linguistics.](https://) 

Requirements:

python: 3.x

pytorch: 1.5+

gensim: 3.x



The data pre-processing part (processor.py and data.py) were adapted based on Aditya and Suraj's [Transformers-For-Negation-and-Speculation](https://github.com/adityak6798/Transformers-For-Negation-and-Speculation), but added my personal label augmentation options and changed the dataloader structure.
